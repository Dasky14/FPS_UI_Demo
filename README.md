# FPS_UI_Demo
UI Demo project created with Unreal Engine 5.

The project is far too big to upload as a GitHub release, so the latest version will always be hosted on OneDrive. 
Alternatively you can build the executable yourself by downloading the project files, but it's almost twice as large of a download.

### V1.0.1 Windows release:
(19.09.2022) [OneDrive - FPS_UI_Demo_Windows.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Al42uRBk2dGGuFlodRFBNiOgGPCx?e=0enrBS)
