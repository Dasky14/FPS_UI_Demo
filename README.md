# FPS_UI_Demo
A demo project created to showcase the UI and basic character movement in Unreal Engine 5.
The project uses blueprints to create a functional settings UI with setting validity checking for supported resolutions.


In case you want to check the blueprints, most of the UI code is within the pause menu widget and player controller.

### V1.0.2 Windows release:
(20.09.2022) [OneDrive - FPS_UI_Demo_Windows.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Al42uRBk2dGGuFlodRFBNiOgGPCx?e=0enrBS)

The project is far too big to upload as a GitHub release (roughly 3GB), so the latest version will always be hosted on OneDrive. 
Alternatively you can build the executable yourself by downloading the project files, but it's a much larger download due to binaries and unused assets.
